   - Compatible with SQL Server 2019+

3. **Java Version:**
   - Written for Java 11 or higher
   - No external dependencies except JDBC driver

4. **Time Format:**
   - dep_time and arrival_time use TIME type
   - Format: 'HH:MM:SS' (24-hour)
   - DATEDIFF calculates minutes between times

5. **Sample Data:**
   - Realistic airline data
   - Includes pilot named "Smith" for IQ1
   - Multiple LAX flights for IQ2 and Problem 2
   - Various passenger tiers for stored procedure 2

### Customization Points

Students can easily customize:
1. Test data values (different pilot IDs, names)
2. Number of tests (minimum 3 required, can do more)
3. Additional sample data in `Database_Setup.sql`
4. Index choice in Problem 2 (if different reasoning)
5. PDF formatting and layout
